# Signal-Processing-for-Communications
These are the Lab assignments of ELEC-E5410 Signal Processing for Communications at Aalto University.
The goal is to master digital signal processing techniques sufficient to implement a wireless receiver. The hardware used is RTL-SDR USB dongle, and the receiver algorithms are implemented in Matlab.
The following are the topics for the lab assignmentsï¼š
1. Spectrum estimation using a recorded FM radio signal
2. FM receiver: discriminator, using a signal from RTL-SDR plugged in the computer
3. Efficient filter structures using the extraction of the FM stereo carrier as an example
4. Digital filter banks
5. Frequency synchronization (estimation of  carrier frequency offset) using GSM synchronization channel
6. Symbol synchronization, timing estimation, and demodulation  using RDS
